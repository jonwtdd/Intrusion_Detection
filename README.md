# Intrusion_Detection

This project focuses on detecting network intrusions using machine learning and deep learning models. It classifies network activity as either normal or an attack, using models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Means clustering, and a Neural Network. Through exploratory data analysis, the project identifies key traffic patterns, improving the ability to recognize malicious activity.

As cybersecurity threats continue to grow, this project helps automate intrusion detection by distinguishing between safe and suspicious network traffic. By comparing machine learning and deep learning approaches, it provides insights into which methods are most effective for identifying attacks. These findings can be applied to real-world security systems to strengthen network protection.
